#Groo-Food: A Hackathon Adventure

Hey there! Groo-Food is our brainchildâ€”a mockup website born out of a whirlwind hackathon session after just a month of diving into the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We took inspiration from Grabfood, employing the magic trio of JavaScript DOM, HTML, and CSS to bring our vision to life.

The challenge? A tight deadline of just one day. I led the crafting of the DOM and added some styling for the main page.

Our website features a list of restaurants, including menus and a shopping cart. 
Behind the scenes, I developed a database in JavaScript object format, exploring the organization of menus nested under different restaurants. Making the food list to be dynamic based on the chosen restaurant was a bit of a head-scratcher, but with some clever event listeners and toggles, I cracked the codeâ€”menus now appear and vanish with a click.

The shopping cart had its own adventure. Initially designed for the side, it ended up at the bottom of the menu section after some struggles. Thanks to the DOM, I'm able to seamlessly integrate menus with the cart. Now, as customers add or delete items, the menu and total price dance to the rhythm.

For styling, I enhanced the homepage using vanilla CSS, experimenting with flexbox, transitions, and pseudo-classes.

Sure, many things still can be improved, but overall, I'm quite happy about this project. I've learned tons, had a blast experimenting with my DOM, all within the ticking clock of our hackathon. Cheers to quick learning and pushing boundaries! ðŸš€

Also kudos to my team!
